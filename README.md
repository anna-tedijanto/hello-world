# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

My name is Anna Tedijanto and I am a freshman at Cornell University studying computer science. Though I am just building my knowledge and love of CS, I'm excited for all the opportunities it has to offer, specifically in design, user experience, human-computer interaction. Please feel free to contact me at tedijanto.anna@gmail.com if you have any questions!
